# Cybersecurity Threat Assessment

## Objective
Assess risk level based on user actions

## Possible Computational Techniques
1. Risk scoring
2. Weighted factors

## Flask UI Component
1. Checkboxes and inputs; threat level colour-coded

## Types of Dataset
1. Cybersecurity incident reports
2. vulnerability databases

## Possible Sources for Dataset
1. NIST
2. OWASP
3. cybersecurity frameworks
4. CVE database

## Dataset URLs
1. https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds
2. https://cve.mitre.org/data/downloads/

## Setup Instructions
20. Cybersecurity Threat Assessment
1. Flask app with security checkboxes and system info
2. Score risk from frameworks (e.g. NIST)
3. Weigh different threat types
4. Build vulnerability-impact database
5. Show threat levels using colours
6. Provide prioritised security advice
7. Add step-by-step fixes
8. Visualise security domains
9. Test with varied setups
